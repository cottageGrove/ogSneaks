# ogSneaks 
Native iOS application for listing sneakers that you have.
AWS s3 is used for storing images. The backend is built with node.js hosted by heroku. Try it out and add your own sneakers! 

Think of it as a sneaker closet :)


Run pod install before you run the application to install AWS and SDWebImage dependencies
    pod 'AWSCore'
    pod 'AWSCognito'
    pod 'AWSS3'	
    pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 4.0'

<div align="center">
  <img src="/screenshot1.png" width="400px"</img> 
  <img src="/screenshot2.png" width="400px"</img>
</div>
